# English-to-tamil-mt

This repository contains a fine-tuned version of the Facebook M2M-100 model specifically designed for English-to-Tamil language translation. 
Leveraging the power of the original pretrained model, we have fine-tuned it using a high-quality parallel corpus of English and Tamil sentences. 
The resulting model excels in accurately translating English text into Tamil, capturing nuances and maintaining context throughout the translation process. 
Our fine-tuning process involved careful parameter adjustments and iterative training to ensure optimal performance for this language pair.
Feel free to explore and utilize our fine-tuned model to enhance English-to-Tamil 
translation applications, research, or any other related projects.
